# week 0- 
week was easy as it was the intro. i learned about built in functions,
how to write my own function,
how to call my function,
introduces to the concept of reading documentation.
the problem sets was not hard but it reinforces concepts that was covered especially using built in functions
out of all the problem sets i found the eintein.py and tipcalculator the most fun as it had a bit of challenging things about both
the challenging aspects was that it had a bit of math and the tipcalcular had a skeloton for us to fill in the empty functions.
we also learned the f string which makes writing a string more convenient.
we also learned about scope which is a variable defined in a function is not available outside of it
